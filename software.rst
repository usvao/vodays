Web based tools like `ADS Labs`_ and `Discovery Portal`_ are known to run on
Firefox 5.0+.  Please do not use Internet Explorer for these tutorials.

.. sidebar:: Java Applications

    A few of our tools are built on the Java technology and depend
    upon Oracle Java to 
    be `installed <http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>`_ to run.
    
    Java for your Mac is installed via the Software Update tool within
    Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7.
    
TOPCAT, ds9

Both `TOPCAT`_ and `ds9`_ have versions for all major operating systems.  See 
also notes on Java applications.

`Seleste`_ is a Java based tool that is launched with Java Web Start file. 
You download the webstart file from the 
`Graphical Interface <http://cdatest.cfa.harvard.edu/seleste/index.html#GUI>`_
section of the Seleste website. 

Iris
^^^^

`Iris`_ is a Java+Python tool that runs on Mac and Linux. It does not 
currently run on Windows due in part to the Python dependencies. While 
Iris is not officially supported on Mac OS X 10.7 *Lion*, it will work 
for the purposes of this demo.
