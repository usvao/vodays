Quasars, Fermi, ALMA, oh my!  
============================

Recent (and future) surveys that observe the whole sky at high energy and
mm/submm wavelengths will help fill the gaps in the multi-wavelength
observations of some of the most interesting astronomical sources (like
quasars), and constrain their emission mechanisms.

Our story begins under the following hypothetical: one has just acquired ALMA
data on a Fermi source. Not just any Fermi source but the famous source `3C273`_,
the first quasar ever to be identified. This radio-loud quasar was also very
recently detected by Fermi as 2FGL J1229.1+0202, and has already has a large amount of
multi-wavelength data.

How do these new data (Fermi, ALMA) augment the extant SED and what physical
knowledge can be deduced by their incorporation?
