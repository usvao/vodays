Evidence for Galaxy Mergers
===========================

Consider the recent paper `A close nuclear black-hole pair in the spiral galaxy NGC 3393 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.477..431F>`_
by Fabbiano et al. (2011).

For this object, `NGC 3393`_ is there evidence from deep optical images or
radio HI data that would help to deduce the characteristics of the merger
event(s) that may have propagated this close black hole pair?
