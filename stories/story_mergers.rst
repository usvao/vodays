Consider the recent paper 
`A close nuclear black-hole pair in the spiral galaxy NGC 3393 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.477..431F>`_
by Fabbiano et al. (2011).

For this object, `NGC 3393`_ is there evidence from wider fielddeep optical
images or radio HI data that would help to deduce the characteristics of the
merger event(s) that may have propagated this close black hole pair?
