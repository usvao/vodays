Discovering new data on the Enigmatic T Tau YSO
===============================================

`T Tau`_ is a multiple component protostar in the Taurus molecular cloud. 
It has companions on a scales of a few arcseconds and a reflection nebula 
between 45 and 60" from the system (Hind's Nebula).

Scientific reasons for studying T-Tau include:

* How do recently released measurements in infrared catalogs like WISE or 
  UKIDSS augment the source's SED?  
* How variable has T Tau been in the near-IR, comparing UKIDSS to 2MASS or in 
  the mid-IR, comparing Spitzer to WISE?  
* Are there new high resolution images of the binary components?
