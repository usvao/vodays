Science Stories
===============

When we use the term "Story" we are talking about a narrative version of a
research problem. Science tories can vary in many ways: focusing on different
object types (quasars versus young stars); spanning all sky or on a single
object or cluster; identifying correlations to deducing causation to explicit
modeling.

The tutorials build on this narrative by inserting the specific tools into the
narrative as a means to solve part of the overall problem.

One to two stories should be used for the VO Day.
