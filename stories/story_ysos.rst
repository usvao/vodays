As with many of these science stories, including :ref:`sci_blazars`, one 
overarching question is how new, especially panchromatic data can be folded
together to deduce new physical connections and processes.

Is there a relationship between the magnetosphere and the disk of young stars?
This topic has been 
`frequently in the literature <http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/cgi-bin/topicSearch?q=Is+there+a+relationship+between+the+magnetosphere+and+the+disk+of+young+stars%3F&qtype=RELEVANT&db_key=AST&db_key=PRE&arxiv_sel=astro-ph>`_.
Past studies have been focused on correlations in emission in different **optical** 
bands, e.g., U, B, V optical photometry from a single catalog.
With recent surveys (IR, X-ray) this has become wider in scope as we better
understand the physics of young stars. If young stars have IR excess due to 
circumstellar disks and young stars emit X-rays due hot accretion spots and
from enhanced magnetic activity due to rapid rotation:

* Can we deduce a relationship between the disk flux and X-ray flux that might 
  reveal or constrain their coupling?
