Welcome to VO Community Days!
=============================

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is realizing global electronic integration of
astronomy data, tools, and services for use by individuals around the world.
This new environment of interoperability will facilitate astronomy research
with a speed, efficiency, and effectiveness not previously possible, and it
will be available to all researchers, independent of their affiliation or
access to observing facilities.

During this "VO Day", aimed at research astronomers, VO experts from the
Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) - one of many VO projects worldwide -
will demonstrate new tools and services for data-intensive astronomy in the
context of a range of science use cases and tutorials.

The tutorials will be structured to permit the audience to follow along with 
their laptops; wireless access and power will be provided.  Please see the
:ref:`logistics` page for more details.
